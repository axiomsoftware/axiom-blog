About Axiom Stack:
-----------------------------------------

Axiom is an object-oriented web application framework, like Ruby on Rails, Struts, et al, built by Axiom Software, Inc. It has a built-in web server, fully searchable object database, and dead-simple zen-like application development. Rather than a compiled language like Java, Axiom applications are written purely in ECMAScript (Javascript). 

The Axiom Stack website is at: http://www.axiomstack.com

You will find plenty of documentation there to get started and learn how to develop web applications with the Axiom Stack.


How to build the source:
----------------------------------------

To build the source code into the Axiom jars, execute the following command (requires ANT to be installed):

ant -buildfile /path/to/build.xml jar

Successful completion of the jar ANT task will result in the Axiom Stack being built to lib/axiom.jar


Dependencies:
----------------------------------------

The Axiom Stack source depends on a customized Lucene implementation.  This customized implementation comes with the Axiom Stack and is located at lib/axiom-lucene.jar; therefore, you don't need to do anything extra to get this customized version with the source you just downloaded.  However, if you would like the source code for the customized Lucene version, please go to http://file.axiomstack.com/public-bzr/lucene-trunk
